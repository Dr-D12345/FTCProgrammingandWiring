# Modifier Type(ACM) 

ACM:`Access Control Modifiers`

Java provide a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. The four access levels:

- Regular Variable - Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.
- `private`-Visible to the class only.
- `public`-Visible to the world.
- `protected`-Visible to the package and all subclasses.

# Modifier Type(NCM) 

NCM:`No-Access Modifiers`

Java also provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionality:

- The `static` modifier for creating class methods and variables.
- The `final` modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, method, and variables.
- The `abstract` modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.
- The `synchronized` and `volatile` modifiers, which are used for threads.
